# Boilerplate for nginx with Let’s Encrypt on docker-compose

> This repository is accompanied by a [step-by-step guide on how to
set up nginx and Let’s Encrypt with Docker](https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71).

`init.sh` first generate `app.conf` for nginx, with the domain name and proxy server from the environment variables file. It then fetches and ensures the renewal of a Let’s
Encrypt certificate for one or multiple domains in a docker-compose
setup with nginx.
This is useful when you need to set up nginx as a reverse proxy for an
application.

## Installation
1. [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/wmnnd/nginx-certbot.git .`

3. Modify configuration:

Create a file named .env in the repository root. Place your domain name and url of the proxy server in the .env file.

```
DOMAIN_NAME=<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME eg: example.com>
SERVER_URL=<PROXY_URL eg: http://localhost:8000>
```

4.  Run the init script:

        ./init.sh

5.  Run the server:

        docker-compose up
